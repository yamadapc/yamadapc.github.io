  <h3>about me</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>
    I'm a SÃ£o Paulo based developer, currently working with the web. Having mostly
    written JavaScript code for production use, my interests in programming range
    from Machine Learning to UX and programming language design. I'm a little
    paranoid about testing and code quality.
    </p>
    <p>
    On my free-time, I'm mostly writting Haskell and D code, but I'm also
    proeficient with Python and C, and have touched Clojure, Erlang, Scala and
    Golang.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm set to go to Hacker School's fall 2 batch, starting October 6th, where
    I'll try studying more theoretical Computer Science by putting it in practice
    and perhaps take my shot at solving language-agnostic dependency/package
    management.

    The best way to reach me is probably through twitter, but my email is
    <b>tacla.yamada "at" gmail</b> if you can't reach me otherwise.
